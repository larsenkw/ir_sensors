IR Sensor Package for ROS
################################################################################

There are currently three nodes in this package required to run the demo. One of these nodes is for reading a phone app which should be merged into the Arduino node once the bluetooth hardware arrives, leaving only two nodes to worry about.

Required files:
ir_sensor_node.ino (Arduino node code)
ir_data_process.py (data processing code)
'20-150cm Inverse Plot Data.csv' (data for IR regression function)

================================================================================
Nodes
================================================================================
ir_sensor_node/ir_sensor_node.ino

This is the code that is run on the Arduino and must be uploaded through by using the IDE if not already on the Arduino. Take note of the port that the Arduino is on because you will need to edit that in the '.launch' file if it is different.

ir_data_process.py

This code subscribes to the raw data sent by the Arduino, processes it, then sends it to the controller as a PoseStamped message. The major structure is the 'IRSensors' object which stores the data and functions used to find the average of the past few data points to dampen noise and compute the pose of the person in front.

================================================================================
Adding Custom Messages to Arduino Library
================================================================================
Make message files ([message_file].msg) as outlined in the ROS tutorials and place them in the 'msg' directory of your package.

Go to the top level of your Catkin workspace and perform the make command.

$ catkin_make

This should generate the appropriate message files required. Then remove the current 'ros_lib' folder from the Arduino libraries folder (this is found where your sketchbook folder is, typically ~/sketchbook/libraries). You have to remove all files in the 'ros_lib' folder.

$ rm -r ~/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib

Then remake the folder with the following command.

$ rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py ~/sketchbook/libraries

A new 'ros_lib' folder will appear which should contain the messages you created in your package. Navigate to the 'ros_lib' folder and make sure you package name is listed there when using 'ls'.
